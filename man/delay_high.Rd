\arguments{
\item{delays}{List of delays, with flexible structure.
Each delay in the \code{delays} list can be one of:
\itemize{
\item{a list representing a distribution object}
\item{a discretized delay distribution vector}
\item{a discretized delay distribution matrix}
\item{a dataframe containing empirical delay data}
}}

\item{delay}{Single delay or list of delays.
Each delay can be one of:
\itemize{
\item{a list representing a distribution object}
\item{a discretized delay distribution vector}
\item{a discretized delay distribution matrix}
\item{a dataframe containing empirical delay data}
}}

\item{delay_distribution_final_report}{Distribution of the delay between the events collected in the incidence data
and the a posteriori observations of these events.}

\item{cutoff_observation_probability}{value between 0 and 1.
Only datapoints for timesteps that have a probability of observing a event
higher than \code{cutoff_observation_probability} are kept.
The few datapoints with a lower probability to be observed are trimmed off
the tail of the timeseries.}

\item{is_partially_reported_data}{boolean.
Set to \code{TRUE} if \code{incidence_data} represents delayed observations
of infection events that themselves rely on further-delayed observations.}

\item{delay_until_partial}{Single delay or list of delays.
Each delay can be one of:
\itemize{
\item{a list representing a distribution object}
\item{a discretized delay distribution vector}
\item{a discretized delay distribution matrix}
\item{a dataframe containing empirical delay data}
}}

\item{delay_until_final_report}{Single delay or list of delays.
Each delay can be one of:
\itemize{
\item{a list representing a distribution object}
\item{a discretized delay distribution vector}
\item{a discretized delay distribution matrix}
\item{a dataframe containing empirical delay data}
}}

\item{partial_observation_requires_full_observation}{boolean
Set to \code{TRUE} if \code{partially_delayed_incidence} represent
delayed observations of infection events that
themselves rely on further-delayed observations.
See Details for more details.}

\item{correct_before_smoothing}{Boolean.
Default is TRUE, parameter exists only for comparison purposes.}
